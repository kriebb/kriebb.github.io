## Introduction

I am going to learn about ethical hacking, which means using hacking skills to protect systems and data. The importance of cybersecurity continues to grow as technology becomes more essential in our lives. Understanding cybersecurity will help me to grow as a software architect in an enterprise size companies. Fifteen years ago, there was a gap between software developers and system engineers. These days, that gap has been closed due to native cloud software development. To spike my career further, I want to be the bridge between the software developers and the cybersecurity experts. Security is difficult and, in my humble opinion, you tend to implement practises when you understand them.

I will learn a 5-day course named [Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)](https://iclass.eccouncil.org/courses/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh-v12-sk/)  in my time. My goal is getting a better understanding. I will take the CEH exam. But my real goals are to have a more in-depth understanding of the whole world of cybersecurity and be the bridge between Security and Development.

 
## Overview of the Course

The CEH program covers many topics. After seeing the video Module 00, It seems taht I will explore areas like:

* Foot printing: Gathering information about a target.
* Vulnerability Analysis: Finding weaknesses in systems.
* Malware Threats: Learning about different types of harmful software.

This course should help me think like a hacker while also learning how to defend against cyber threats.

## Learning Approach
As I take the CEH course, it is essential for me to build a strong foundation first. This means learning the basics before moving on to more complex topics. The course is structured with various modules, and I will have both lectures and labs to practice what I learn. 

* Practice in Labs: Creating a Virtual environment where I can practise, so I can engage with the given labs. That should give me hands-on experience and a chance to use different tools. However, they do supply me with a remote lab environment where I can practise. Maybe I will start using there environment and not losing time setting up my own.
* Review and Revisit: I will not hesitate to go back to previous lessons and labs. 
* Books: They do supply me with a book that consists out of 2000 pages :|  . Do I fully understand why I am going to do? 

## Exams in the CEH Program
There will be two exams in the CEH program:

* Multiple Choice Exam: This is a multiple-choice test with 125 questions. I hear that I have four hours to complete it, and the passing score ranges from 69% to 84%...

* Practical Exam: This exam includes 20 challenges based on lab exercises. Passing both exams will earn me the title of CEH Master, which is a significant achievement in the field of cybersecurity. This will be the more difficult one, I think.

## What can you do with such an exam?
Completing the CEH course could open doors for me in cybersecurity and having a CEH certification is a start at least for roles like:

- Security Analyst
- Penetration Tester
- Forensics Investigator

However, as I stated in the beginning, my goal is to be the bridge between software development and cybersecurity to become a better consultant in development teams in big enterprise, or maybe, who know, a security analyst? ... time will tell.
