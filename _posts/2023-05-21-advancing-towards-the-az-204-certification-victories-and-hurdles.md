## Previously on...

At the beginning of the year, [I challenged myself](https://dotnet.kriebbels.me/devretro2022-my-adventure-in-consultancy) to pass a tech exam called [AZ-204](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-204/). In this blog post, I'll talk about my experience that leads up to taking the exam and share my process of studying for it.

## Context

As a consultant, obtaining certifications demonstrates to potential customers that I have gone beyond the minimum expectations, giving them more confidence when working with me. However, it's crucial to remember that while certification shows a certain level of knowledge, it doesn't necessarily reflect a complete understanding of the subject.

After I began working for [Xebia | Xpirit](http://xpirit.com/), one of my tasks was to earn Azure certifications such as the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) and AZ-204 (Azure Developer Associate). I decided to start with the AZ-204 because I was advised to wait on the AZ-900 until Microsoft offered free certification exams.

## Move heaven and earth to get started

Getting started with something new can be challenging. I know what I want to achieve and often have a vision of the end result, but taking those first steps requires significant mental effort. When faced with a new goal, I typically break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.

## Getting a certificate is challenging

When I began studying for the AZ-204 exam, I approached it like studying in high school or university. I started with theoretical knowledge through Pluralsight videos, followed by reading and note-taking from the Microsoft learning path. To evaluate my understanding, I took a free practice exam from CyberVista.

Unfortunately, I scored only 22%. This was a clear indication that my approach wasn't working. Despite feeling discouraged, I recognized that I had gained some knowledge about Azure and its ecosystem, but I needed a different strategy.

## The four stages of learning

According to the [four stages of competence model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence), learning a new skill progresses through distinct phases:

| Stage | Description | My Status |
|:------|:------------|:----------|
| **Unconscious incompetence** | Not knowing what you don't know | I was past this stage |
| **Conscious incompetence** | Recognizing your lack of skill and its value | I was clearly here after my test results |
| **Conscious competence** | Understanding how to perform the skill but requiring concentration | I had some competence with Azure services I used daily |
| **Unconscious competence** | Performing the skill effortlessly and being able to teach others | Not applicable at this point |

After my disappointing test results, I reached out to [Bas van de Sande](https://azurecodingarchitect.com/), who recommended studying for one hour daily using [ExamTopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-204/) and [Microsoft's learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-204/).

## Finding the right learning strategy

I initially tried to brute-force my way through studying, expecting quick results. This approach led to frustration, especially when using ExamTopics, where the community discussions about correct answers often created more confusion than clarity.

After several attempts with diminishing returns, I decided to follow Bas's advice of studying one hour daily. I also took a recommendation from [Kristof Van Hees](https://xpirit.com/team/kristof-van-hees/) to try Whizlabs, which offers interactive questions with immediate feedback and clear explanations.

## Setting a deadline

Despite my self-doubt, I purchased an exam slot and the MeasureUp practice test, which I highly recommend. The MeasureUp tests are more challenging than Whizlabs but provide excellent explanations for correct and incorrect answers, along with relevant documentation links.

On my first MeasureUp test, I scored 55% - still below the 70% passing threshold. This experience helped me realize how to study effectively for the exam.

## My optimized study method

After trying different approaches, I developed the following effective study strategy:

1. Begin with Microsoft's learning path to understand fundamental concepts and their relationships
2. Watch summary videos to reinforce key points
3. Practice with questions from Whizlabs:
   - Make your best guess
   - Review explanations thoroughly
   - Visit linked documentation for deeper understanding
4. Practice daily for a limited time (one hour) to maintain focus and avoid burnout
5. Use MeasureUp practice tests to gauge exam readiness

## Summary of certification resources

Here are the resources I found most valuable:

- [Reddit r/AzureCertification](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureCertification/search/?q=az%20204&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=): Community support and shared experiences
- [Thomas Maurer's AZ-204 Study Guide](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-204-study-guide-developing-solutions-for-microsoft-azure/): Comprehensive study guide
- [Microsoft Learn AZ-204 Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-204/): Official learning materials
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/developing-solutions-for-microsoft-azure): Structured video courses
- [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/): Interactive practice tests with clear explanations
- [MeasureUp](https://www.measureup.com/): Difficult practice tests that closely mirror the actual exam

## Show off your hard work

I recommend adding your certifications to your LinkedIn profile to showcase your skills and achievements to potential employers and clients. Don't be hesitant to share your accomplishments - as long as you remain humble and gracious, there's nothing wrong with being proud of your hard work.

You can add your certification to your LinkedIn profile using [Credly](https://www.credly.com/), which provides a verified digital badge.

## Closing thoughts

I initially struggled with how to structure this post - should I focus solely on how to achieve the AZ-204 certification, my personal journey, or the effects of obtaining the certification? I ended up combining these approaches to share my failures, pitfalls, and improved study methods, hoping this might help others.

I was pleasantly surprised when people at [Techorama](https://techorama.be/) 2023 asked when I would publish a new blog post. This accountability motivates me to continue writing. At the beginning of my blogging journey, I set a goal to publish weekly posts in 2023 to build my authority in this space.

In my next post, I'll discuss why I took a break from blogging and what helped me regain focus. I remain committed to protecting my privacy while sharing valuable insights, as [I promised in a previous post](https://dotnet.kriebbels.me/how-to-know-if-your-data-is-leaked).
