## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners.

## How we use cookies

IT KRIEBBELS uses cookies in a very limited way, respecting your privacy. We only use:

### Essential Cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable basic functions like page navigation, language preferences, and theme selection. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| theme_preference | Remembers your dark/light mode preference | 1 year |
| jekyll_language | Stores your language preference | 1 year |

## Analytics

For website analytics, we use Cloudflare Web Analytics, which **does not use cookies** and respects your privacy. Unlike traditional analytics tools:

- Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use cookies
- Does not track users across websites
- Does not collect any personal data
- Is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR

This means you can browse our website without any tracking cookies being set. For more information about Cloudflare Web Analytics, please visit [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## Third-party services

### hCaptcha

We use hCaptcha on our contact form to prevent spam. hCaptcha is a European alternative to reCAPTCHA that respects your privacy. To learn more about hCaptcha's privacy practices, please visit [hCaptcha's Privacy Policy](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy).

### Formspree

Our contact form uses Formspree, a GDPR-compliant form processing service. Formspree processes the data you submit through our contact form. To learn more about how Formspree handles your data, please visit [Formspree's Privacy Policy](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/).

## Do Not Track

Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.

## GDPR and Your Privacy Rights

- Be informed about how your data is used

- Correct inaccurate data
- Delete your data
- Restrict processing of your data
- Object to data processing
- Be notified if there is a data breach affecting your information

Because we use minimal cookies that don't collect personal information, and our analytics solution is cookie-less and privacy-focused, your rights under GDPR are already respected when using our website.
