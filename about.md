Thanks to my ADHD-driven energy and curiosity, I continuously learn and always look for ways to improve existing processes.

## Senior .NET Developer

- dedicated to [clean code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM), [SOLID principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF7rQmSRlq0), and comprehensive testing.
- I value simplicity and clarity in every solution.

## Security-minded

- embedding security practices (OIDC, token handling, supply-chain security) directly into development to build **reliable** and thus trustworthy software.

## Coaching & Teaching

- I genuinely enjoy guiding colleagues and clients, breaking down complex challenges into understandable *baby*steps, and helping others **become independent**ly successful.
  
## Growth & Learning

- Driven by curiosity (and a bit of ADHD-energy), I'm continuously exploring new technologies and ideas—always aiming to stay ahead and deliver solutions that last.
