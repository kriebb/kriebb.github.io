## Mission
I help businesses build secure and straightforward IT solutions by simplifying complex challenges, focusing on coaching, testing, and best practices (such as SOLID principles).

## Vision
I believe in a future where (cloud) infrastructure, (cloud) software development and (cloud) security naturally reinforce each other through continuous learning. My freelance work allows me the freedom to collaborate openly, transparently, and effectively with businesses that also value and want to boost their quality, integrity, and knowledge sharing to a next, feasible level. 

## Core Values

### Customer Intimacy
I prioritize understanding each client's specific needs and business context. By closely collaborating, I deliver tailored solutions that truly add value. This approach ensures that clients receive what they genuinely need, not just what they think they want.

### People First
I deeply value respect, empathy, and human connection in every interaction. Effective collaboration stems from genuine relationships built on mutual respect, trust, and understanding.

### Knowledge First
Continuous learning is essential. I actively explore new technologies, best practices, and methodologies. Sharing this knowledge with clients and colleagues fosters collective growth and continuous improvement.

> *Perspective*: Core values are fundamental beliefs that guide behavior and decision-making, serving as an internal compass for navigating life's choices. [Source: Science of People](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/core-values/)

### Integrity
Transparency and reliability are central to my work ethic. I communicate expectations clearly, uphold commitments ( or communicate when those can not be met in time), and consistently provide honest, straightforward advice.

> *Definition*: Integrity stands for honesty, sound moral principles, being ethically driven, and focusing on doing the right thing. [Source: Lucidity](https://getlucidity.com/strategy-resources/top-ten-most-common-company-values/)
